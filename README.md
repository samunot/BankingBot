<h1> Banking Bot </h1>

<h3> Inspiration </h3>
<p>Today everything in business deals with catering ease to customer. With our application we aim at providing customers with with ease, help them better manage and save money in an interactive and innovative way using a chat bot.</p>
 
<h3> Implementation </h3>
<p>We have implemented a chat bot on Slack application using node js and Capital One Nessie APIs.
The bot implements the following features:<br>
- Banking Bot allows you to manage your accounts and carry out all your banking activities using simple instructions.<br>
- At each purchase, the bot gives you a new way to save by rounding up debit/credit card purchases to the next dollar and adds that spare change to the customer's savings account.<br>
- We try to incorporate a social factor to banking by allowing customers to add a friend circle, and try and achieve targets to earn cashback.
 </p>

<h3> Challenges </h3>
<p>1. Integration of different Capital One APIs with our application.<br>
2. Understanding and implementation of chat bot on Slack.<br>
3. Keeping the bot simple and easy to use.</p>

<h3> Learning and Accomplishment </h3>
<p>
- We successfully implemented the chat bot implementation and in process understood, how to think as customers/end users while development.
- How to explore new API's so that you can use them efficiently during application development. <br>
</p>

<h3> Furure Scope </h3>
<p>
- Allow customers to manage multiple accounts across multiple banks and generate statements.<br>
- Currently the existing friend circles are restricted to one bank. Future scope is to allow customers to have friend circle across multiple banks.<br>
- Application of machine learning to recommend products and discount coupons to give user more opportunities to make reasonable purchases and also earn cashback.
